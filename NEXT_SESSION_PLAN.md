## Key Design Notes for Next Session

### Game Concept Refinements Made
1. **Enemies**: All "cats" renamed to "blobs" throughout codebase and docs
2. **Level Structure**: Mario-style discrete levels (not endless tower)
3. **Start Animation**: Planned mining cart intro with 3-2-1 countdown
4. **HUD Addition**: Flash power-up circular timer indicator needed
5. **Theme**: Consistent abandoned underground mine aesthetic

### Technical Context
- **Debug Mode**: Currently OFF (GameSettings.debug = false)
- **Flash Power-up**: 100% spawn rate in chests (FOR TESTING - needs reset to 10%)
- **Repository**: 7 commits ahead of origin/main, ready for next sprint
- **Red Blob AI**: Simplified (no ladder climbing) - chase same floor, patrol different floors

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1st Priority: Audio & Atmosphere Sprint
**Why**: Biggest impact for effort - transforms entire game experience
- Background music with underground mine theme
- Complete SFX library (jump, collect, combat, chest opening)
- Cave ambience with depth-based variations
- Flash power-up timer UI implementation

### Alternative: Balance & Progression Sprint  
**Why**: Implements Mario-style level system and proper game progression
- Discrete level structure with clear completion goals
- Progressive blob type and collectible unlocks
- Achievement system and persistent high scores
- Reset testing values to production balance
