## Key Design Notes for Next Session

### Game Concept Refinements Made
1. **Enemies**: All "cats" renamed to "blobs" throughout codebase and docs
2. **Level Structure**: Mario-style discrete levels (not endless tower)
3. **Start Animation**: Planned mining cart intro with 3-2-1 countdown
4. **HUD Addition**: Flash power-up circular timer indicator needed
5. **Theme**: Consistent abandoned underground mine aesthetic

### Technical Context
- **Debug Mode**: Currently OFF (GameSettings.debug = false) with all console.log statements removed
- **6-Tier System**: Fully active across all 50+ levels with balanced progression
- **Enemy Distribution**: Anti-clustering algorithms ensuring varied, engaging gameplay
- **Repository**: Latest commit includes comprehensive 6-tier system implementation
- **Production Ready**: Clean codebase with comprehensive documentation and safety systems
- **Treasure Chests**: Enhanced safety zones preventing item collection issues

## Recommended Next Steps
