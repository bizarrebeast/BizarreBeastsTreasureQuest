## Enemy Design Details

### Wall Crawler Spiders
- **Movement**: Stick to walls and ladder sides, move at consistent speed
- **AI**: Follow wall paths, drop to lower platforms when player is below
- **Special**: Can climb on ceiling and drop down as surprise attacks
- **Weakness**: Vulnerable when dropping, can be jumped on mid-fall

### Ceiling Droppers  
- **Trigger**: Activate when player walks underneath within detection zone
- **Behavior**: Fall straight down with brief warning indicator
- **Recovery**: Crawl back to ceiling after missing player
- **Strategy**: Require player timing and awareness of overhead threats

### Floor Patrols
- **Size**: Larger than regular blobs, take up more screen space
- **Movement**: Patrol entire floor width, push other enemies aside
- **Difficulty**: Require multiple hits or special strategy to defeat
- **Reward**: Higher point value and guaranteed collectible drop

### Mini-Boss Design
- **Frequency**: Every 20-25 floors as milestone encounters
- **Arena**: Special room layout designed for boss mechanics
- **Mechanics**: Unique attack patterns and movement abilities
- **Rewards**: Guaranteed rare collectibles and significant point bonuses

## Power-Up Mechanics

### Speed Boost (8-12 seconds)
- **Effect**: +50% movement speed, +30% climb speed
- **Visual**: Speed trails behind player, subtle screen effects
- **Strategy**: Ideal for escaping dangerous situations quickly
- **Spawn**: 15% chance from treasure chests

### Invincibility (5-8 seconds)
- **Effect**: Player flashes and takes no damage from enemies
- **Limitation**: Still vulnerable to environmental hazards
- **Visual**: Glowing outline, sparkle effects around player
- **Spawn**: 8% chance from treasure chests, rare floor spawn

### Double Points (15-20 seconds)
- **Effect**: All point collection doubled (coins, enemies, floor bonuses)
- **Visual**: Golden aura around player, enhanced point popup effects
- **Strategy**: Best used when many collectibles are available
- **Spawn**: 12% chance from treasure chests

### Super Jump (10-15 seconds)
- **Effect**: Higher jump height, longer air time for better enemy targeting
- **Mechanics**: Can clear larger gaps, reach higher platforms
- **Visual**: Jump arc trails, enhanced landing effects  
- **Spawn**: 10% chance from treasure chests

### Time Slow (6-10 seconds)
- **Effect**: All enemies move at 30% normal speed
- **Player**: Normal speed maintained for tactical advantage
- **Visual**: Subtle slow-motion effect, time distortion around enemies
- **Spawn**: 5% chance from treasure chests (rarest power-up)

## Environmental Hazard Systems

### Falling Rocks
- **Trigger**: Player movement or time-based random events
- **Warning**: Shadow indicators show where rocks will fall
- **Damage**: Instant defeat if hit, but can be avoided with timing
- **Frequency**: Increases with floor depth, more common in deeper levels

### Spike Traps
- **Pattern**: Retract and extend on timed cycles (3-4 second intervals)
- **Warning**: Visual and audio cues before activation
- **Placement**: On narrow platforms where players must time crossings
- **Interaction**: Spikes push player upward if hit, causing damage

### Crumbling Platforms
- **Mechanics**: Collapse 2 seconds after player steps on them
- **Warning**: Platform shakes and changes color before collapse  
- **Strategy**: Forces quick movement and planning ahead
- **Recovery**: Platforms respawn after 10-15 seconds

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Spider enemies successfully crawl on walls and ladders
- [ ] Complete power-up system with 5 different temporary effects
- [ ] Environmental hazards add challenge without frustration
- [ ] Biome system creates visual variety and thematic progression
- [ ] Boss encounters provide memorable milestone challenges
- [ ] New mechanics integrate smoothly with existing systems
- [ ] Performance remains stable with increased complexity
- [ ] Player progression feels rewarding with new content variety

## Technical Requirements

- Temporary effect system with visual indicators and timers
- Physics system extensions for environmental hazards
- Biome theming system with asset management
- Boss encounter state machine and AI framework
- Enhanced collision system for complex enemy interactions

## Balancing Considerations
- Power-ups should feel powerful but not game-breaking

- New enemies should have clear weaknesses and strategies
- Boss encounters should test player skills without requiring luck
- Biome progression should feel natural and rewarding

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 3-4 days (Spider Enemies)

## Notes for Implementation
- Start with spider enemies as they extend existing enemy system
- Design power-ups to complement existing gameplay rather than replace it
- Test environmental hazards extensively for fairness and fun factor
- Keep biome transitions smooth and performance-friendly
- Plan boss encounters as special experiences, not damage sponges
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing save systems

## Post-Sprint Opportunities
- Additional biome themes (ice caves, magma chambers)
- More complex multi-phase boss encounters
- Environmental puzzles requiring power-up combinations
- Seasonal events with temporary new content
- Community-designed enemy types and mechanics
- Advanced environmental storytelling through level design
