# DGEN1 Alignment Fixes Applied

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### 1. Display Bounds Logging
- **Fixed**: Player position now shows actual bounds instead of "initialize"
- **Added**: Detailed position tracking with offset calculations
- **Shows**: Both physics body and visual sprite boundaries

### 2. World & Canvas Dimensions
- **Floor Width**: Adjusted from 24 to 22 tiles (704px wide, fits in 720px canvas)
- **Floor Height**: Reduced from 10 to 8 for better fit
- **Floor Spacing**: Custom 140px spacing (was 160px) for better vertical fit

### 3. Camera Settings
- **Follow Offset**: Reduced from 100 to 50 pixels for 720x720 format
- **Detection**: Automatically uses dgen1 settings when running on port 3001

### 4. Debug Information Added
When you play now, the console shows:

#### Player Position (every 2 seconds):
```javascript
{
  position: {x, y},           // Player sprite position
  bodyBounds: {               // Physics collision box
    left, right, top, bottom,
    width, height
  },
  displayBounds: {             // Visual sprite bounds
    left, right, top, bottom,
    width, height  
  },
  camera: {                    // Camera position
    scrollX, scrollY,
    width, height
  },
  offset: {x, y}              // Difference between physics and visual
}
```

#### Ladder Creation:
```javascript
ü™ú Ladder created: {
  x, bottomY, topY,           // Ladder placement
  ladderY, ladderHeight,      // Calculated position
  isGroundFloor,              // Ground floor check
  canvasHeight                // Canvas reference
}
```

## üìê New Settings for 720x720

### GameSettings.dgen1.ts:
- Canvas: 720√ó720px
- Floor Width: 22 tiles (704px)
- Floor Height: 8 tiles
- Floor Spacing: 140px between floors
- Game Area: 560px (720 - 80 HUD - 80 controls)

### Result:
- Can fit ~5 floors in view
- Proper margins on sides (8px each)
- Better vertical spacing
- Centered camera view

## üîç How to Verify Alignment

1. **Check Player Position**: 
   - Look for offset values in console
   - Should be close to 0 if aligned

2. **Watch Ladder Logs**:
   - Ladders should fit between floors
   - Ground floor ladders shouldn't extend below

3. **Visual Check**:
   - Player sprite should match collision box
   - Ladders should align with platforms
   - No clipping or floating sprites

## üéÆ Testing the Fixes

With the game running at http://localhost:3001/:

1. Move the player around
2. Check console for position logs
3. Climb ladders - should align properly
4. Jump - sprite should match physics
5. Check enemies align with platforms

The alignment should now be correct for the 720√ó720 dgen1 format!
