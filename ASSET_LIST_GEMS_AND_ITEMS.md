## üé® Visual Style Guidelines

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Theme**: Underground mining/treasure hunting
- **Style**: Clean, colorful, slightly cartoonish
- **Lighting**: Gems should have bright highlights to show they're valuable
- **Contrast**: Items should stand out against dark cave backgrounds

### Gem Characteristics
- **Facets**: Visible cut lines to show these are cut gems, not rough stones
- **Highlights**: White/bright spot to show light reflection
- **Shadows**: Subtle darker areas for depth
- **Sparkle**: Optional particle effects or star highlights

### Consistency Requirements
- All gems should feel like part of the same set
- Similar line weights if using outlines
- Consistent highlight positioning (e.g., top-left)
- Similar saturation levels across colors

- Test assets against both light and dark backgrounds
- Consider creating a sprite sheet if making multiple animation frames
