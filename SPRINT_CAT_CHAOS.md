# ‚úÖ SPRINT: BLOB CHAOS UPDATE - COMPLETED

## Sprint Goal ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
Transform the game with blob enemies, combat system, visibility mechanics, and enhanced collectibles.

**STATUS: ALL PHASES COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## 1. Enemy System Overhaul üü¶

### Blob Enemy Types
**Ground Blobs (formerly beetles):**
- **Blue Blob:** Standard patrol behavior at normal speed
- **Yellow Blob:** Slower speed, slightly random movement patterns  
- **Green Blob:** Bouncing movement, travels full floor width

**Ceiling Blobs (new enemy type):**
- Start attached to ceiling (bottom of floor above)
- Drop trigger: Player passes underneath and moves 1 tile away
- Fall straight down with flip animation
- Brief landing pause, then chase player at 1.5x speed
- Can be squished after landing
- Placement: 0-1 per floor until level 20, then 0-2 per floor

### Implementation Notes:
- Rename Beetle.ts to Blob.ts and update all references
- Create CeilingBlob.ts extending Blob with drop behavior
- Add color property to Blob class for visual variety
- Implement chase AI with 1.5x speed multiplier

## 2. Combat System üéØ

### Jump-to-Kill Mechanic
- Player can kill blobs by jumping on them
- **Bounce behavior:** Auto-bounce on kill (slightly less than normal jump)
- **Points:** 200 points per blob killed
- **Squish animation:** Simple scale down effect
- **Vulnerability:** Ceiling blobs only vulnerable after landing

### Combo System
- **Window:** 1 second between kills to maintain combo
- **Multiplier:** 1x ‚Üí 2x ‚Üí 3x ‚Üí 4x ‚Üí etc.
- **Score calculation:** 200 √ó combo multiplier
- **Visual feedback:** "COMBO x2!" popup text
- **Mid-air reset:** Successful kill resets jump for chain combos

## 3. Visibility System (Vignette) üî¶

### Darkness Mechanic
- **Complete black** outside player's visibility radius
- **Radius:** 5 tiles around player
- **Hard edge** transition (no gradual fade)
- **Dynamic:** Areas re-hide when player moves away
- **Affects everything:** Platforms, ladders, enemies, coins all hidden

### Flash Power-up
- **Effect:** Reveals full screen for 5 seconds

4. **Treasure Chests:** 2500 points + contents
5. **Flash Power-up:** Special ability item

### Rarity & Placement
- **Regular coins:** 2-4 per floor (current)
- **Blue coins:** 1 per 1-2 floors
- **Diamonds:** 1 per 1-3 floors  
- **Treasure chests:** 1 per 1-3 floors (starting floor 3)
- **Placement:** Random + challenging spots for rare items

### Treasure Chest Mechanics
- Requires action button ("E" key / mobile "ACTION" button)
- Button appears left of jump button when near chest
- Brief opening animation (player vulnerable)
- **Contents:** 5-10 coins + chance of diamond + chance of flash power-up
- Full reset on death (chests respawn)

## 5. UI/UX Updates üé®

### Point Popups
- **All collectibles:** Show "+50", "+500", "+1000" etc.
- **Enemy kills:** Show "+200" with combo multiplier
- **Chest opening:** Show total value gained
- **Style:** Float up and fade out animation

### Action Button
- Desktop: "E" key for interaction
- Mobile: "ACTION" button (left of jump)
- Larger text than jump button
- Only visible when near interactable

### Movement Support
- Add WASD as alternative to arrow keys
- W = Up, A = Left, S = Down, D = Right
- Both control schemes work simultaneously
