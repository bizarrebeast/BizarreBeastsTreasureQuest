## Secret Tips from BizBe

1. **The First Jump**: Your first enemy stomp in a combo is worth normal points, but subsequent stomps multiply!

2. **Treasure Chest Wisdom**: Chests in bonus levels ALWAYS contain good rewards - never curses!

3. **Life Economy**: Sometimes it's worth taking damage to grab a Heart Crystal

4. **Blu Strategy**: Save your invincibility specifically for Blu - that 1000 points is the highest single enemy value

5. **Level Transitions**: New chapters start at levels 11, 21, 31, and 41 - expect difficulty spikes!

6. **Safe Climbing**: Enemies avoid ladder zones, making them perfect for planning your next move

7. **Curse Management**: If you get a curse from a chest, find a safe corner and wait it out

8. **The 150 Rule**: Always count your gems - at 145, prioritize finding 5 more for that free life!
