## Files Needing Future Updates

### Low Priority (Historical/Planning Docs)
- **GAMEPLAN.md** - Has "7 enemy types" but is historical record
- **FINAL_STEPS_TODO.md** - Has "7 enemy types" but is old todo list
- **RELEASE_NOTES.md** - Has "7 enemy types" but may be for older version
- **DEBUG_TEST_LEVEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Has "7 enemy types" but debug only
- **ENEMY_EXPANSION_PLAN.md** - References "17 enemy types" for future expansion

These files represent historical planning documents or future expansion plans and don't need immediate updates.

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation is Current** - All player-facing and developer documentation accurately reflects the 9-enemy roster
2. **Rex Integration Complete** - Documentation properly shows Rex as fully integrated
3. **Blue Caterpillar Fixes Documented** - Stuck detection improvements are noted
4. **Historical Files Preserved** - Old planning docs left unchanged for reference

## Conclusion

Documentation review complete. All critical documentation has been updated to reflect:
- 9 enemy types (added Rex and Blue Caterpillar)
- Rex fully integrated into spawning system
- Blue Caterpillar stuck detection improvements
- Current game state as of September 2024

The game documentation accurately represents the current state of Treasure Quest with its complete 9-enemy roster and all recent improvements.
