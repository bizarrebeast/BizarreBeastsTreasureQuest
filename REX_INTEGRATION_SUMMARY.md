## Balance Impact

### Difficulty Progression

- Its 500 point value rewards skilled players who can defeat it
- The flipping movement adds visual variety without overwhelming difficulty

### Spawn Distribution
- Rex is introduced in late tutorial (levels 4-10) at 10% to familiarize players
- Maintains consistent 15% presence from levels 11-50+
- Helps bridge the difficulty gap between early and late game enemies

### Enemy Variety
- Rex adds an 8th enemy type to the roster
- Provides unique movement pattern (jumping patrol) distinct from other enemies
- Reduces spawn percentage concentration on single enemy types

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Spawn Testing**
   - Verify Rex spawns correctly in levels 4+
   - Check Rex doesn't spawn in levels 1-3
   - Confirm spawn percentages match distribution

2. **Collision Testing**
   - Test jump-to-kill mechanic works
   - Verify side collision causes player damage
   - Check Rex-to-Rex pass-through behavior

3. **Visual Testing**
   - Confirm flip animation during jumps
   - Verify blinking animation while grounded
   - Check green particle burst on death

4. **Score Testing**
   - Verify 500 points awarded on kill
   - Check combo multiplier applies correctly
   - Confirm Rex kills tracked in stats

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor frame rate with multiple Rex enemies
   - Check memory usage with particle effects
   - Verify no lag with 4-5 Rex per floor

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust Rex spawn percentages based on playtesting
2. **Sprite Enhancement**: Consider adding more animation frames
3. **Sound Effects**: Add unique jump/death sounds for Rex
4. **Difficulty Scaling**: Apply speed multipliers consistently
5. **Special Variants**: Consider color variations (Blue Rex, Gold Rex)
