## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Actions
- **Movement:** Joystick/arrow keys for horizontal movement
- **Climbing:** Up/down on ladders
- **Jumping:** Jump button to clear gaps and avoid enemies
- **Combat:** Fire button to defeat enemies (if applicable)

### Controls âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Mobile:** âœ… Virtual joystick for movement/climbing + jump button with multi-touch support
- **Desktop:** âœ… Arrow keys for movement/climbing, spacebar for jump
- **Dual Input:** âœ… Both control schemes work simultaneously

## Level Design âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Structure âœ… FULLY BUILT
- âœ… Single endless tower with procedurally generated floor layouts  
- âœ… Dynamically generates new floors as player climbs higher
- âœ… 24-tile wide floors for dynamic gameplay (expanded from 14 tiles)
- âœ… Varying platform arrangements with random gaps
- âœ… Smart ladder placement distributed across floor thirds

### Procedural Generation Rules âœ… ACTIVE
- âœ… Ensures all platforms are reachable via ladder placement validation
- âœ… Smart ladder positioning with solid ground validation above/below
- âœ… Balanced enemy density (2-4 beetles per complete floor, 1-2 per gap sections)
- âœ… Guarantees upward progression with proper ladder connections
- âœ… 70% chance of gaps per floor for variety
- âœ… Ground floor protection prevents infinite falling

## Enemies & Obstacles âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Enemy Types âœ… ACTIVE
- **Beetles:** âœ… Move horizontally across platforms with patrol boundaries
- **Movement Patterns:** âœ… Predictable back-and-forth patterns within platform sections
- **Collision Behavior:** âœ… Beetles reverse direction when hitting each other
- **Smart Placement:** âœ… Respect platform gaps and safe zones
- **No Falling:** âœ… Beetles stay on their designated platform sections

### Future Additions ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- **Spiders:** Crawl along platforms and down ladders (not yet implemented)

## Power-ups & Collectibles

### Collectible Items âœ… PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
1. **Coins:** âœ… Basic point value items scattered throughout levels with spinning animations
2. **Power-up Items:** ðŸ”„ Grant temporary abilities (planned for future)

### Coin System âœ… ACTIVE
- âœ… 2-4 coins randomly placed per floor on solid platforms
- âœ… Avoid ladder positions for clean gameplay
- âœ… Collection animation with scale/fade effects
- âœ… 50 points per coin collected

### Future Power-ups ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- **Invincibility:** Brief immunity to enemies (5-10 seconds)
- **Speed Boost:** Faster climbing and movement (8-12 seconds)  
- **Double Points:** Multiplies all points earned (15-20 seconds)

## Difficulty Progression

### Scaling Elements
- Gradual enemy speed increases as height increases
- Higher enemy spawn frequency at greater heights
- More complex platform arrangements every X floors

### Future Additions (Post-MVP)
- New enemy types with unique patterns
- Narrower platforms requiring precise jumps
- Longer gaps between platforms
- Moving platforms or environmental hazards

## Scoring System âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Point Awards âœ… ACTIVE

- **Professional HUD:** âœ… Real-time score display with stylish UI

### Current Implementation âœ… WORKING
- âœ… Live score tracking with formatted display
- âœ… Floor counter showing current height
- âœ… Semi-transparent HUD background for readability
- âœ… Bold styling for clear mobile visibility

### Future Additions ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- **Defeating Enemies:** 100 points per enemy (combat system needed)
- **Combo System:** Consecutive actions multiply score
- **High Score Integration:** Remix platform leaderboards

## Player Character

### Design
- Custom character based on original artwork

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Phaser.js Considerations
- Use Phaser's built-in physics for platforming mechanics
- Implement tile-based level generation system
- Sprite-based animation system for characters and enemies
- Particle effects for power-ups and collectibles

### Remix Integration
- Server-side high score validation
- User authentication for leaderboards
- Progressive enhancement for offline play
- Save game state to local storage

## MVP Features âœ… COMPLETED
