# Spawning System Improvements - Implementation Summary
## Date: 2025-08-31

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. ✅ Ladder Spawning System (GameScene.ts - Lines 2354-2427) - REVISED
- **Ground Floor**: 2 ladders with 6+ tile separation (for accessibility)
- **Upper Floors**: 1 ladder only (for challenge and strategy)
- **Anti-Stacking**: Avoids placing ladders directly above each other (3+ tile offset)
- **Randomization**: Uses full random placement, not predictable zones
- **Result**: Restored gameplay challenge while maintaining safety from stuck enemies

#### 2. ✅ Chomper Movement Fix (Cat.ts - Lines 416-447)
- **Changed**: Movement pauses during bite animations
- **Animation States**: 'bite_partial' and 'bite_full' now set velocity to 0
- **Edge Detection**: Added 32-pixel buffer to prevent biting near edges
- **Result**: Chompers no longer get stuck while biting

#### 3. ✅ Snail Enemy Early Introduction (EnemySpawningSystem.ts - Lines 89-119, 219-227)
- **New Tiers**: 
  - Levels 1-3: 'tutorial_early' (no Snails)
  - Levels 4-10: 'tutorial_late' (10% Snails)
  - Levels 11-20: 'basic' (15% Snails)
- **Result**: Better enemy variety in early game

#### 4. ✅ Stalker Trigger Distance (Cat.ts - Line 75)
- **Changed**: Trigger distance increased from 32 to 64 pixels (2 tiles)
- **Result**: Players have more reaction time when approaching stalkers

#### 5. ✅ Zone-Based Enemy Spawning (GameScene.ts - Lines 3124-3151, 2925-2997)
- **Dynamic Zones**:
  - Levels 1-10: 6-tile zones (4 zones on 24-tile floor)
  - Levels 11-30: 5-tile zones (5 zones)
  - Levels 31-50: 4-tile zones (6 zones)
- **Enemy Placement**: Each zone gets max 1 enemy
- **Patrol**: ALL enemies patrol full floor width (over gaps/spikes)

#### 6. ✅ Uniform Spike Patrolling
- **Changed**: Removed 40% random chance
- **Result**: All enemies patrol across spikes/gaps consistently

#### 7. ✅ Stalker Spawn Improvements
- **Changed**: Stalkers now check for ladder/chest conflicts
- **Logic**: If zone has ladder/chest, finds alternative zone
- **Result**: Stalkers won't block important game elements

### Files Modified
1. `/src/scenes/GameScene.ts` - Ladder spawning, zone-based enemy placement
2. `/src/objects/Cat.ts` - Chomper movement pause, stalker trigger distance
3. `/src/systems/EnemySpawningSystem.ts` - New spawn weight tiers with Snails

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Play levels 1-3: Verify no Snails appear
- [ ] Play levels 4-10: Verify Snails appear (~10% of enemies)
- [ ] Check all floors have 2 ladders with proper spacing
- [ ] Watch Chompers bite: Should stop moving during animation
- [ ] Test stalker activation: Should trigger at 2-tile distance
- [ ] Observe enemy spacing: No clustering in same zone
- [ ] Watch enemies patrol: Should cross gaps/spikes freely

### Known Issues
- Warning about duplicate `init()` method in GameScene.ts (pre-existing, not related to our changes)

### Performance Impact
- Zone calculation is more efficient than previous random placement with collision checks
- Reduced number of position recalculations
- Deterministic enemy placement reduces edge cases

### Playtester Feedback Addressed
✅ Enemy clustering - Solved with zone system
✅ Chomper getting stuck - Solved with movement pause
✅ Insufficient ladders - Solved with 2-ladder guarantee
✅ Enemy variety - Solved with early Snail introduction

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to test environment
2. Gather playtester feedback
3. Monitor for any edge cases
4. Fine-tune zone sizes if needed
