# Next Development Plan for Treasure Quest

## Current Game State ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Discrete level system (1-100 then endless) with automatic door progression
- Level-based enemy/collectible unlocks and progressive difficulty
- Fixed scoring system with collision protection and combo mechanics
- Polished UI with centered popups and 1-based floor numbering
- Complete Balance & Progression Sprint implemented

## Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)

### 1. High Score Persistence System üèÜ
**Goal:** Save and display player's best scores across sessions
**Tasks:**
- Implement localStorage-based high score tracking
- Add high score display to game over screen
- Track best score per individual level AND overall best
- Add "NEW HIGH SCORE!" celebration when achieved
- Consider tracking furthest level reached (already partially implemented)

### 2. Achievement System with Unlocks üèÖ
**Goal:** Add progression incentives and replay value
**Tasks:**
- Create achievement definitions (score milestones, level completions, combo achievements)
- Implement achievement tracking and persistence
- Add achievement popup notifications when unlocked
- Consider cosmetic unlocks (player colors, visual effects)
- Achievement display screen/menu

## Secondary Priorities (Medium Term)

### 3. Audio System Implementation üéµ
**Goal:** Complete the game experience with sound
**Tasks:**
- Background music (retro arcade style, looping)
- Essential sound effects: jump, climb, coin collect, enemy kill, level complete
- Audio settings/mute toggle
- Dynamic audio mixing based on game state

### 4. Visual Polish & Assets üé®
**Goal:** Replace placeholder graphics with polished sprites
**Tasks:**
- Custom player character sprite with animations (idle, walk, climb, jump)
- Enemy blob sprites with color variants and animations
- Enhanced collectible sprites (coins, diamonds, chests)
- Background art for underground cavern atmosphere
- Particle effects for collections and power-ups

### 5. Enhanced Gameplay Features üéÆ
**Goal:** Add depth and variety to gameplay
**Tasks:**
- **EVALUATE ENEMY SPAWNING LOGIC**: Review current enemy spawning patterns for more variation and fun gameplay
- New enemy type: Spiders that climb ladders and follow vertical paths
- Additional power-ups: speed boost, invincibility shield, double points
- Enhanced difficulty scaling with level progression
- Special challenge levels or bonus stages

## Future Considerations (Lower Priority)

### 6. Mobile Optimization & Polish üì±
- App store preparation (icons, screenshots, metadata)
- Performance optimization for older devices
- Touch control refinements based on user testing
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 7. Advanced Features üöÄ
- Online leaderboards (if deploying to web/app stores)
- Daily challenges with special objectives
- Multiple character skins/unlockables
- Social features (share scores, screenshots)

## Technical Debt & Cleanup üîß
- Code organization and documentation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Bug testing on different devices/browsers
- Automated testing for core game mechanics

## Recommended Order of Implementation

1. **Start with High Score System** - Quick win that adds immediate value
2. **Add Achievement System** - Builds on high score system, adds replay value  
3. **Implement Audio** - Major quality of life improvement
4. **Visual Polish** - Makes game feel more professional
5. **New Gameplay Features** - Adds content variety

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions

- Flash power-up spawn rate is correctly set to 10% (was temporarily 100% for testing)
- All scoring bugs have been fixed (double collection/kill protection implemented)
- Door system works automatically on contact (no key press needed)
- Floor numbering is 1-based for user display (internally still 0-based)
- Combo system disabled while climbing ladders for balance
- Ground floor (Floor 1) is safe zone with no enemy spawns
- Level progression: 10‚Üí15‚Üí20‚Üí25 floors (+5 every 5 levels)

## Current Todo List Status
‚úÖ Bonus level system implemented after levels 10, 20, 30, etc.
‚úÖ Invincibility speed boost (1.5x) and collectible collision fixes completed
üîÑ Next priorities: High Score Persistence + Achievement System
üìù Production reminder: Evaluate enemy spawning logic for more variation and fun
