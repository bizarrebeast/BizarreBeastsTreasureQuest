## üèóÔ∏è Test Environment Layout

### Platform Structure
```
Floor 2: [================] (with ladder access)
         |  |
Floor 1: [================] (with ladder access)
         |  |
Floor 0: [================] (ground level, full width)
```

### Special Features
- **Player Spawn**: Center of Floor 0
- **Enemy Spawn Zones**: Distributed across all floors
- **Ladder Placement**: Strategic positioning for movement testing
- **Edge Testing**: Platform boundaries for patrol behavior

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Enemy Behavior Testing
```
1. Press 'A' to spawn all enemy types
2. Press 'H' to show hitboxes
3. Observe patrol patterns and boundaries
4. Test jumping on enemies
5. Press 'C' to clear and repeat
```

### 2. Combo System Testing
```
1. Spawn multiple enemies (keys 1-7)
2. Jump on enemies in quick succession
3. Observe combo counter and point multiplication
4. Verify point popups show correct values
```

### 3. Power-up Testing
```
1. Press 'I' for invincibility
2. Press 'P' for projectile power-ups
3. Test enemy interactions during power-up
4. Observe timer countdown in HUD
```

### 4. Performance Stress Test
```
1. Press 'F' to show FPS
2. Repeatedly press 'A' to spawn many enemies
3. Monitor FPS drop threshold
4. Press 'C' to clear when done
```

### 5. Hitbox Verification
```
1. Press 'H' to enable hitboxes
2. Spawn specific enemy types
3. Verify collision boxes match sprites
4. Test player-enemy collision accuracy
```

## üêõ Common Debugging Uses

### Issue: Enemy Getting Stuck
1. Spawn the problematic enemy type
2. Enable hitboxes with 'H'
3. Observe movement patterns
4. Check platform edge detection

### Issue: Combo Not Working
1. Spawn 3-4 enemies close together
2. Jump on them rapidly
3. Check if combo counter increments
4. Verify point calculations

### Issue: Power-up Timer Wrong
1. Press 'I' or 'P' for power-ups
2. Watch timer countdown
3. Verify effect ends at zero
4. Check for timer overlap issues

### Issue: Performance Problems
1. Press 'F' for FPS display
2. Spawn enemies until FPS drops
3. Note enemy count at performance threshold
4. Test on different speed settings

## üí° Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Testing
- Use number keys for specific enemy types rather than 'A' for all
- Clear enemies with 'C' between tests for clean state
- Use speed controls to slow down for detailed observation
- Toggle hitboxes only when needed (impacts performance)

### Enemy-Specific Testing
- **Caterpillar**: Test random movement doesn't get stuck
- **Beetle**: Verify roll-and-bite cycle timing
- **Chomper**: Check stuck detection and recovery
- **Snail**: Test faster speed scaling
- **Jumper**: Verify bounce height consistency
- **Stalker**: Test activation range and chase behavior
- **BaseBlu**: Verify immovable property and stun mechanics

### Advanced Debugging
- Combine multiple power-ups to test interactions
- Use grid overlay ('G') for precise positioning tests
- Test ladder climbing with enemies nearby
- Verify enemy spawn distribution patterns

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Test Features
TestScene is designed to be extended. Common additions:
- New enemy spawn keys (8, 9, 0)
- Additional power-up tests
- Custom platform layouts
- Automated test sequences

### Modifying Test Environment
Located in `/src/scenes/TestScene.ts`:
- Platform positions: Lines 150-180
- Enemy spawn points: Lines 300-400
- Control panel layout: Lines 700-800
- Keyboard handlers: Lines 850-900

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Not Production Code**: TestScene is excluded from production builds
2. **Performance Impact**: Hitbox display affects FPS
3. **State Isolation**: Changes don't affect main game save
4. **Memory Usage**: Many enemies can cause memory issues
5. **Touch Controls**: Limited on mobile (keyboard preferred)
