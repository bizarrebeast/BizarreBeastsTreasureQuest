# Audio & Atmosphere Update Sprint ðŸ”Š

**Status:** PLANNING  
**Goal:** Transform the silent game experience into an immersive audio-rich underground adventure  
**Priority:** HIGH - Major impact on player engagement  

## Sprint Overview
Add comprehensive audio system and atmospheric effects to enhance player immersion and game feel. This sprint focuses on creating a cohesive audio identity that matches the underground mining theme while providing satisfying audio feedback for all player actions.

## Core Features

### Background Music System
- **Underground Theme**: Looping atmospheric background music with mining/cave theme
- **Dynamic Layers**: Music that can layer or change based on floor depth or danger level
- **Fade System**: Smooth transitions between different musical states
- **Volume Control**: Player adjustable music volume settings

### Sound Effects Library
**Player Actions:**
- Jump sound (satisfying hop with slight echo)
- Landing sound (footstep on stone/dirt)
- Ladder climbing sounds (hand-over-hand climbing)
- Player death sound (dramatic but not harsh)

**Combat Audio:**
- Enemy squish sound (satisfying defeat audio)
- Bounce sound when jumping on enemies
- Combo audio cues (escalating pitch for multi-kills)

**Collectibles Audio:**
- Coin collection (classic "pling" with slight reverb)
- Blue coin collection (richer, deeper tone)
- Diamond collection (crystalline chime)
- Treasure chest opening (mechanical click + treasure jingle)
- Flash power-up collection (electrical zap sound)

**Enemy Audio:**
- Red stalker blob warning sound (ominous low growl during eye phase)
- Blob movement sounds (subtle squelching steps)
- Enemy spawn/activation sounds

### Atmospheric Audio
- **Cave Ambience**: Subtle background sounds (water drops, distant wind)
- **Depth Audio Cues**: Ambience changes as player goes deeper
- **Spatial Audio**: Pan sounds left/right based on screen position
- **Echo System**: Subtle reverb on sounds to enhance cave feeling

### Audio Settings System
- **Master Volume**: Overall game volume control
- **Music Volume**: Background music specific control  
- **SFX Volume**: Sound effects specific control
- **Mute Toggle**: Quick mute/unmute functionality
- **Audio Preferences**: Persistent settings storage

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Audio Foundation
- Set up Phaser audio system and asset loading
- Create audio manager class for centralized sound control
- Implement basic volume controls and settings persistence
- Add audio file format support (MP3/OGG for compatibility)

### Phase 2: Core Sound Effects
- Implement all player action sounds (jump, climb, collect)
- Add combat audio feedback (enemy defeat, bouncing)
- Create collectible audio with appropriate tones and reverb
- Test audio timing and synchronization with visual effects

### Phase 3: Background Music & Ambience
- Compose or source underground theme music (looping)
- Implement background music system with fade controls
- Add cave ambience layer with water drops and subtle wind
- Create depth-based audio variations for deeper floors

### Phase 4: Advanced Audio Features
- Add red stalker blob warning audio during eye phase
- Implement spatial audio panning for positional sound effects
- Create audio feedback for UI interactions (button presses)
- Add screen shake audio cues for impacts and explosions

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization
- Balance all audio levels for cohesive experience
- Optimize audio file sizes and loading performance
- Add audio accessibility options (visual indicators for audio cues)
- Test audio experience across different devices and browsers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete background music system with underground theme
- [ ] All major game actions have appropriate sound effects
- [ ] Audio settings panel with volume controls
- [ ] Atmospheric cave ambience enhances immersion
- [ ] Red stalker blob audio warning system implemented
- [ ] Spatial audio positioning works correctly
- [ ] Audio experience is consistent across platforms
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with audio system active

## Technical Requirements
- Phaser audio API integration
- Audio asset management system
- Persistent settings for audio preferences
- Cross-browser audio format compatibility
- Mobile audio handling (user gesture requirements)
- Audio file optimization and compression

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Foundation + Core SFX)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (Music + Advanced Features)  
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 days (Polish + Optimization)
- **Total**: 5-8 days

## Dependencies
- Audio assets (music tracks, sound effects)
- Phaser audio system
- Browser audio API support
- Mobile audio interaction requirements

## Notes for Implementation
- Start with essential sound effects (jump, collect, defeat)
- Use Web Audio API through Phaser for better control
- Consider audio file size impact on loading times
- Test audio latency on different devices
- Plan for accessibility (visual cues for important audio)
- Keep audio theme consistent with retro underground aesthetic

## Post-Sprint Opportunities
- Dynamic music that responds to danger/excitement level
- Voice over for achievements or special events
- Advanced spatial audio with 3D positioning
- Music composition tools for procedural background tracks
- Audio-driven gameplay mechanics (rhythm-based challenges)
